# 📅 Day 5 - 100 Days of Code - Python

## 🔁 Python Loops Overview

Today, I explored **loops** in Python — an essential tool for repeating actions multiple times. Loops help automate tasks and process collections of data efficiently.

## 🔄 Types of Loops

- **For Loop**:  
   A loop that repeats a specific number of times, often used when you know exactly how many iterations you need.
   - Example: Using `range()` to loop from 0 to 4 and print powers of 2.

- **For Loop with Lists**:  
   A loop that directly iterates over a list’s elements.
   - Example: Printing a message for each fruit in a list of fruits.

## 🔢 Common Loop Use Cases

- **Finding the Sum of a List**:  
   Python even offers a built-in `sum()` function, but I practiced summing manually using a loop.
- **Finding the Maximum Value in a List**:  
   Looping through the list to track the largest value.
- **Finding the Minimum Value in a List**:  
   Similar process, but tracking the smallest value instead.

## 🕹️ Mini-Project: FizzBuzz

I implemented the classic **FizzBuzz game**, which prints:
- "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
- "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
- "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both.

This is a great exercise in combining **loops** with **conditional logic**.

## 🚀 Day 5 Project - Strong Password Generator

Today’s project was a **Strong Password Generator**, which:
- Asks the user how many **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols** they want in their password.
- Randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
- Ensures the password contains a randomized mix (not just in order like letters-then-numbers-then-symbols).

### 🔑 Key Concepts Practiced

- Using `random.choice()` to pick random elements.
- Building a list of characters, shuffling them, and assembling the final password.
- Handling **user input** to customize the password strength.

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

Loops are one of the **most fundamental building blocks** in Python (and any programming language). Combined with conditions, they allow me to write **efficient and dynamic programs**. The **password generator project** helped tie together loops, randomization, and user input into a practical, useful tool.
