# 🚀 Day 2 - 100 Days of Code - Python

## 🔎 Overview
Welcome to **Day 2** of my **100 Days of Code - Python** journey!  
Today's focus was all about **Python data types**, working with **strings, numbers, booleans**, and building a small **Tip Calculator** project! 💰🧮

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧵 String Indexing
- Accessing characters in strings using **positive** and **negative** indexes.
- Reminder: Python indexing starts at **0**, not 1!

### 🧊 Data Types
| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **String** | Collection of characters (text). |
| **Integer** | Whole numbers (positive/negative). |
| **Float** | Decimal numbers (like `3.14`). |
| **Boolean** | `True` or `False` (capital T/F!). |

### 🕵️‍♂️ Type Checking & Conversion
- Use `type()` to check variable types.
- Convert between types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

### ➕➖ Math Operations
- Classic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`.
- Python follows **PEMDAS** order of operations.  
(P - Parentheses, E - Exponents, MD - Multiply/Divide, AS - Add/Subtract)

### 🧙‍♂️ Variable Magic
- Updating variables using `+=`.
- Combining strings and numbers easily with **f-strings**.

## 💻 Project - Tip Calculator

### 📝 What it Does
A simple command-line tool that:
1. Asks for the **total bill** 💵.
2. Asks how much **tip** you want to leave 💰.
3. Calculates the final bill (including tip).
4. Asks how many people to split the bill 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️.
5. Shows **how much each person pays**, both in full and rounded amounts.
