## 🎸 Project - Band Name Generator

### 🎯 Description
A fun **interactive project** where the user answers a few simple questions, and we generate a **cool band name** based on their responses. 🎵

### 🔄 Project Flow
1. 🎉 Greet the user and explain the purpose.
2. 🧑‍🎤 Ask for the user's **first name**.
