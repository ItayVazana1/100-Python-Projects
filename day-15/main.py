# Day 15 - 100 Days of Code - Python

# Today we move from Beginner level
# to Intermediate level

# The daily project is Coffe machine
# the coffe machine can create more than one
# type of drink - each one with different amount
# of ingredients - milk , water and more..

# another think  that we need to implement is
# the fact that it's coin operated
# there are 4 types of coins (in US)

# Penny = 0.01 (1 cent)
# Nickel = 0.05 (5 cent)
# Dime = 0.1 (10 cent)
# Quarter = 0.25 (25 cent)

# what is the program requirements :

# 1. Print a report
# (It's need to say how many of each ingredient last,
# and what possible type of drinks we can order)

# 2. Check resources sufficient
# after each order we need to make sure we update
# the amount of each ingredient and also the money is
# the box inside the machine
# if it's not possible to make a specific order , it
# should warn  when try to order it.

# 3. Process coins
# we need to make sure we refund the money if there
# isn't enough from it.
# if the value of money is more then the cost - we need
# to calculate the change and return it.

# 4. Check transaction successful
# if false - refund and not make coffe
# if true - make the coffe and update every thing
